# QuestCLI

## Overview

QuestCLI is a Ruby command-line application designed for users who want to manage an RPG-inspired adventurer and quest log.

Users can create an adventurer, accept quests, update quest information, complete quests, earn experience points, level up, and abandon quests they no longer wish to pursue.

The goal is to create a simple but engaging CLI experience that demonstrates CRUD operations, Active Record associations, database management, validations, and object-oriented Ruby design.

# Model Relationships

A Player has many Quests.

A Quest belongs to one Player.

```text
Player
  |
  | has many

Quest
```

```ruby
class Player < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :quests, dependent: :destroy
end

# Technical Challenges

## Managing Active Record Associations

Creating quests that correctly belong to a player and displaying the associated records.

## Updating Existing Records

Showing the current database value before asking the user to enter an updated value.

## Experience and Level Progression

Awarding experience when a quest is completed while preventing the same quest from awarding experience multiple times.

## User Input Validation

Handling invalid menu choices, missing records, blank values, and failed Active Record validations without crashing the application.

## CLI Organization

Separating menu navigation, user input, and database interactions into organized and reusable Ruby methods and classes.

---

# Meeting Project Requirements

## Active Record

All database interactions will use Active Record.

## Models

The application will contain at least two Active Record models:

- Player
- Quest

## One-to-Many Relationship

- Player has many Quests
- Quest belongs to Player

## CRUD Operations

The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete player and quest records.

## Validations

At least one model will contain Active Record validations.

## CLI Classes

The application will contain at least two Ruby classes responsible for menu navigation and CLI behavior.

## Menu Loop

The application will use a loop-based menu that continues running until the user chooses to exit.

## Update Prompts

Update prompts will display the current value before asking the user to enter a replacement.
